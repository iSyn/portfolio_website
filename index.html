              <h2>More Ore v0.5.3</h2>
              <p>Spent the day doodling some new sprites. Bad news, saving doesn't work... it doesn't work completely. I'm going to try using local storage along with cookies maybe to do saving.</p>

              <h2>More Ore v0.5.2</h2>
              <p>Edit: It's way past midnight and I have classes early tomorrow morning but... I GOT SAVING TO WORK! I had an issue because one of my arrays was wonky and I had to find some way around it but not it's all good! Damn... Now i'm too excited to sleep. I guess i'll code some more.</p> <br/>
              <p>Implemented achievements. Although there is only 1 so far, the system is there if I want to add some more. I also added a couple of new store items as well as some upgrades as well. I need to find a way to let users know a new upgrade is available...</p>
              <p>Oh yeah, some new sound effects were put in too! I feel like one of the main things holding this game back is the graphics. I am going to have to redraw all my sprites eventually...</p>

              <h2>More Ore v0.5.1</h2>
              <p>Good news everyone! Procedural item generation has been revamped. I also found a way to procedurally generate the sprite!</p>
              <img src="./assets/image1.png" alt="my mess" height='300px'>
              <p>Obviously it still looks shitty but it's something... Styling is not the greatest but i'll fix it eventually. I still need to adjust values as things aren't balanced at all.</p> <br/>

              <h2>Intro</h2>
              <p>Got rid of the old portfolio website and made this. It's not that great yet but i'll make changes here and there... <br/>Trying something new with this <strong>Dev Journal</strong> thing. I wanted to keep track of the code I write without looking into my git commits. Hopefully i'll keep this updated. <br/></p>
              <h2>More Ore v0.5</h2>
              <p>Really happy with how this project is turning out. I'm learning a lot of new ways to solve problems and creating something that i've always wanted to create. </p>
              <p>Now to finish building the procedural item generation...</p>
