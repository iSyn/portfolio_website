                <p>Making a game is hard...</p>
                <p>It's been a month and there has been a good amount of progress.</p>
                <p>Quests and the refined store has been made but still a work in progress.</p>
                <p>What I am doing right now though is I am rewriting and refactoring a bunch of code. My code has become a huge mess and annoying to deal with.</p>
                <p>Throughout the development process, I learn many new techniques to solve problems and have now implemented said techniques into the code. Hopefully I'll be done by tonight...</p>

              <h2>More Ore v0.6.1</h2>
              <p>
                So... took a little break from coding for little bit more than a week. I was losing my motivation and drive and slowly lost interest in More Ore. I made a small
                post to <a href="http://reddit.com/r/incremental_games" style='color: #2196f3'>/r/incremental_games</a> asking what people thought and it went extremely well!
                <br>
                To my surprise, everyone was extremely nice and positive. This was also my first time showing off my game to a somewhat large audience. Everyone gave me their input and feedback and I responded to mostly every comment.
                <br>
                According to Google Analytics, I had a whopping <span style='font-size: larger'>1,200</span> users visit the site and mess around with whatever they liked. I really enjoyed this experience as well as talking with others with similar interests.
                <br>
                I made a Trello account to keep track of progress as well as ideas to implement in the future to streamline my development progress.
                <br>
                Safe to say, the fire is back! Excited to code yet again!

              <h2>More Ore v0.6 - Vignettes are cool</h2>
              <p>Alright that was hard... Spent yesterday re-writing all my code to be neater and more functional. Saving now finally works which is so amazing. Buttons used to expand on hover but complications came when the player wanted to purchase multiple of the same item. I in turn switched to a tooltip type display similiar to <a href="http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/">cookie clicker</a>. I also removed the upgrades tab as it was annoying to switch back and forth from the store tab to the upgrades tab. Instead, I put upgrades at the top of the store.</p>
              <br/>
              <p>I learned adding a simple vignette effect can make something look 10x as good. It goes from this:</p>
              <img src="./assets/oldsprites.png" alt="">
              <p style='text-align: center'>to this:</p>
              <img src="./assets/newsprites.png" alt="">
              <p>Time to go crazy and add vignettes to everything and ruin a once cool effect...</p>

              <p>Spent the day doodling some new sprites. Bad news, saving doesn't work... it doesn't work completely. I'm going to try using local storage along with cookies maybe to do saving.</p>

              <p>Edit: It's way past midnight and I have classes early tomorrow morning but... I GOT SAVING TO WORK! I had an issue because one of my arrays was wonky and I had to find some way around it but not it's all good! Damn... Now i'm too excited to sleep. I guess i'll code some more.</p> <br/>
              <p>Implemented achievements. Although there is only 1 so far, the system is there if I want to add some more. I also added a couple of new store items as well as some upgrades as well. I need to find a way to let users know a new upgrade is available...</p>
              <p>Oh yeah, some new sound effects were put in too! I feel like one of the main things holding this game back is the graphics. I am going to have to redraw all my sprites eventually...</p>

              <p>Good news everyone! Procedural item generation has been revamped. I also found a way to procedurally generate the sprite!</p>

              <p>Obviously it still looks shitty but it's something... Styling is not the greatest but i'll fix it eventually. I still need to adjust values as things aren't balanced at all.</p> <br/>

              <h2>Intro</h2>
              <p>Got rid of the old portfolio website and made this. It's not that great yet but i'll make changes here and there... <br/>Trying something new with this <strong>Dev Journal</strong> thing. I wanted to keep track of the code I write without looking into my git commits. Hopefully i'll keep this updated. <br/></p>
              <h2>More Ore v0.5</h2>
              <p>Really happy with how this project is turning out. I'm learning a lot of new ways to solve problems and creating something that i've always wanted to create. </p>
              <p>Now to finish building the procedural item generation...</p>
